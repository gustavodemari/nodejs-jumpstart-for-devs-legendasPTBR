1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
right now and %uh

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
nap in 10 minutes in fact no Jess isn't good at everything out there anyway but

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
we want to do is going to focus on what no jess is good at

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
so we're gonna build a web application first things first

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
we need to get ourselves and tools to work with so use

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
the node package manager to do that the N CAM repository

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
is a collection have third party software that is available for everyone

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
to use

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
we're gonna make ourselves

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
an application folder called ap sprint and we want to work with is well as many

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
frameworks out there I'm gonna pick one

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
something to get started with and I'm going to

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and p.m. install express at a particular version

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
just because I know this version works

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
there better ways of managing application which will see later

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
but this look it up in going because we'll be able to create ourselves

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
a web framework without having to actually build everything from scratch

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
will likely notice that we have a node modules folder one thing I think and Kim

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
got really really right

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
was it opposed to having a centralized location for all of our packages get

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
installed to

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
by default packages are installed into the local directory

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
which means that we have all the rights to use them and they don't collide with

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
other people's packages

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
let's make use I've express

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
to create a project scaffolding

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
not that I can spell that would go yes I want to continue in my non empty

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
directory:

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
now this is where we can see how node JS and teamwork

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
excellently I have a package that Jason folder which will take a look at later

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
this allows me to manage dependencies I love my

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
program where I'm at I can do a simple NPM install

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
everything I need gets downloaded

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and get a cup coffee

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
can hang out I can pretend my code is compiling

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
there we go we're done and now we have enough to do it

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
basic lol program and make sure everything is working most programs in

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
node

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
actually are begun by running the note interpreter on a particular

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
file we do that whether application

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
we run note on tap that JS expressed by default runs on port 3000

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and less is tech test this out here hello world expressed welcome to express

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
we have achieved
